# TRIANGLE TRACKER
#### This project determines the type of triangle based on the sides inputted by the user, 3rd November 2018
#### By **Stella Ndirangu**
## Description
The Triangle Tracker determines the type of triangle based on the sides the user inputs. It shows whether the sides can make an equilateral triangle, isosceles and a scalene triangle based on the size of the sides. To begin, the user can only input 3 sides. For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. For it to be an isosceles triangle, two of the sides are exactly equal. For scalene traingles,none of the sides are equal, however the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side. Lastly, if the sum of any two sides is equal to or less than the third side then a triangle cannot be formed.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Web browser
## Specifications
The website
1. Displays an error message when no values are entered
* INPUT:""
* OUTPUT: "Values of a triangle have to be greater than 0"

2. Displays an error message when negative values are entered
* INPUT: "-5, 7, 9"
* OUTPUT: "Values of a triangle have to be greater than 0"

3. Checks the condition : if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side
* INPUT: "3,2,9"
* OUTPUT: "This is not a triangle!"

4. Checks if all the sides entered are equal
* INPUT: "10,10,10"
* OUTPUT: "This is an Equilateral Triangle"

5. Checks if two sides entered are equal
* INPUT: "10,10,12"
* OUTPUT: "This is an Isosceles Triangle"

6. Checks if all sides entered are different
* INPUT: "3,4,5"
* OUTPUT: "This is an Scalene Triangle"
