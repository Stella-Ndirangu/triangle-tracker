#### By **Stella Ndirangu**
## Description
The Triangle Tracker determines the type of triangle based on the sides the user inputs. It shows whether the sides can make an equilateral triangle, isosceles and a scalene triangle based on the size of the sides. To begin, the user can only input 3 sides. For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. For it to be an isosceles triangle, two of the sides are exactly equal. For scalene traingles,none of the sides are equal, however the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side. Lastly, if the sum of any two sides is equal to or less than the third side then a triangle cannot be formed.
