# TRIANGLE TRACKER
#### This project determines the type of triangle based on the sides inputted by the user, 3rd November 2018
#### By **Stella Ndirangu**
## Description
The Triangle Tracker determines the type of triangle based on the sides the user inputs. It shows whether the sides can make an equilateral triangle, isosceles and a scalene triangle based on the size of the sides. To begin, the user can only input 3 sides. For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. For it to be an isosceles triangle, two of the sides are exactly equal. For scalene traingles,none of the sides are equal, however the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side. Lastly, if the sum of any two sides is equal to or less than the third side then a triangle cannot be formed.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Web browser
## Specifications
Triangle Tracker determines whether, given 3 sides, it will make a triangle. It also shows which type of triangle it can make based on the sides inputted.
* The program has one function called triangle
*  All user inputted values are changed to Integers to avoid errors 
*Check whether all values are greater than 0
* If values are greater than 0, check whether the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or greater than the third remaining side
* If so then check whether, all sides are equal. This is an Equilateral triangle.
* Check whether two sides are equal. This is an Isosceles triangle
* If none of these are met, then it is a Scalene triangle.
* If the second IF statement fails then it is not a triangle.
